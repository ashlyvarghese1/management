### Project Description
[Our project is a Diabetes Prediction Web Application that allows users to input health-related parameters like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and more. Using a trained logistic regression model, the app predicts the risk of diabetes, providing real-time feedback as "High Risk" or "Low Risk".]

### The Problem statement
[Our project addresses the critical problem of early detection of diabetes, which often goes undiagnosed until serious health complications arise. By providing a quick, accessible, and data-driven risk assessment tool, we aim to help individuals identify potential risks early, encouraging timely medical consultation and proactive health management.]

### The Solution
[We're solving it by turning boring medical stats into a click-and-predict magic trick! üöÄ Just enter a few health details, hit a button, and voila!‚Äîour smart model predicts if you're at risk of diabetes, like a fortune teller but with data instead of a crystal ball. üîÆ‚úÖ]
